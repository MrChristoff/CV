## Chris Lawrence

I am a Full Stack Developer, former IT support analyst and amateur arborist. I have a burning desire to make systems work perfectly, and a calm analytical approach to problem solving.
Having spent over a decade as an IT support analyst in the tech and media industry I have a wealth of experience working in technical teams, that has taught me how to communicate effectively with a diverse range of colleges. I took a break from the rat-race and spent an amazing year working in conservation, it was this time that gave me the perspective and confidence to do something I am passionate about and not compromise, so I took the plunge and, successfully completed Europeâ€™s leading developer boot camp: Makers Academy

I'm looking for a role that lets me grow my development skills to be able to build solid, adaptable solutions, in a team that can be friends, not just colleagues.  

## Skills

#### Exceptional communicator

As a support analyst communication was key to all my roles. I have found that giving information is the only a small part of being an effective communicator, the ability to genuinely listen and disseminate the relevant information is often the most important part of effective communication. I have developed the ability to communicate with both technical and non-technical staff, by being able to give high-level concepts to non-technical colleagues and giving detailed technical information to technical staff.

#### Problem solver

IT support throws a dizzying array of problems at you, knowing the answer to all these problems is impossible, so research and methodical debugging of an issue is a skill that has helped me in my new life as a developer.
While working at an independent TV production company I was asked by the group IT Director to move to the head office in order to help with a data migration project that had hit technical problems and stalled. I was able to move the project forward by finding a number of solutions to the technical problems and offered a new approach to completing the project by breaking it down into stages that had a smaller impact on the end user.

#### Relationship builder

I have an open and approachable manner that lets me build strong relationships with not only my immediate team, but also colleagues in the company as a whole (being a effective communicator is no use if no one wants to approach you). I learned a long time ago to drop the 'Them and us' mentality that is common amongst support technicians, I empathise with colleagues having a bad day and don't take ill-tempered communication personally.

| [ChoreMatick](https://github.com/ChoreMatick/ChoreMatick/tree/master/chorematick) | An Amazon Alexa skill (Unpublished, still in development stage) that lets a guardian set chores for a child to complete.  The child is able to request their chore, then tell an Alexa enabled device, once they have completed the task. When the child claims the task is complete, an PIN code is generated and sent with a notification to the parents mobile device. This PIN code can then be used by the parent to confirm the task has been completed The team also put together a short ['advert'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK6xQBi9nB4) for the project. | Java 8, Alexa Skills Kit, AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, JUnit, Mockito and Codeship |
|[Haskell calculator](https://github.com/MrChristoff/interpreter)| Interpreter written in Haskell that takes simple mathematical expressions (multiplication, division, addition, subtraction and parenthesis) in the form of a string. It then tokenises, parses and evaluates the string, returning an integer.| Haskel, Hspec,  Glasgow Haskell Compiler.|

with a particular appreciation for trees and woodlands.
